    "# Phase 3 Project: Maize Disease Classification for Kenyan Farmers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Maize is the primary staple crop in Kenya, feeding millions and supporting livelihoods for over 90% of smallholder farmers. However, diseases such as Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN), Maize Streak Virus, and others cause massive annual losses, exacerbating food insecurity in a country where climate variability already stresses agriculture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stakeholder**: Smallholder maize farmers in Kenya, agricultural extension services in counties (e.g., via MoALF or KALRO), and NGOs supporting rural farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Late detection of maize diseases leads to widespread crop failure and economic loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: This project builds a machine learning classification model to identify maize diseases from leaf images. Farmers can upload phone photos to an app/tool for instant diagnosis, enabling early intervention and better crop management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value**: Early detection could reduce yield losses by 20-50%, improving food security and farmer incomes in Kenya."
