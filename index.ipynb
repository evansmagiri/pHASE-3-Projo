    "# Phase 3 Project: Predicting Bank Account Ownership for Financial Inclusion in Kenya\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Problem\n",
    "Despite the success of mobile money services like M-Pesa, a large portion of adults in Kenya and East Africa remain unbanked – meaning they lack a formal bank account. This limits their ability to save safely, access credit, build financial history, and fully participate in the economy. Financial exclusion is particularly high among rural residents, women, lower-education groups, and informal workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "- Kenyan commercial banks (e.g., Equity Bank, KCB Group, Co-operative Bank)\n",
    "- Fintech companies (Safaricom/M-Pesa, mobile banking providers)\n",
    "- Central Bank of Kenya and government bodies promoting financial inclusion\n",
    "- NGOs and development organizations focused on poverty reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "Build a binary classification model to predict whether an individual has a bank account (\"Yes\" or \"No\") based on demographic, location, and access-related features from survey data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Model Helps Stakeholders\n",
    "The model can identify individuals most likely to be unbanked. Banks and fintechs can use these predictions to:\n",
    "- Target outreach campaigns (e.g., mobile banking sign-ups in rural areas)\n",
    "- Design tailored products for underserved groups\n",
    "- Prioritize regions or demographics for financial literacy programs\n",
    "\n",
    "This directly supports national goals for greater financial inclusion, economic growth, and poverty reduction in Kenya.\n"

    "\n",
    "I also load `VariableDefinitions.csv` to display the meaning of each column. This helps me (and stakeholders) understand what each feature represents in the real world, which is critical for interpreting results later."
